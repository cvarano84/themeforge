/**
 * Loads a resource with three outcomes rather than two.
 *
 * The bug this exists to prevent: pages used `null` or `[]` to mean both "nothing
 * here" and "we never found out", so a failed request rendered as a reassuring
 * empty state — "No movies yet", "All caught up!" — and an outage was
 * indistinguishable from an empty library. Keeping `error` separate from `data`
 * makes that confusion unrepresentable.
 *
 * A failure never clears `data`. So after a successful load followed by a failed
 * refresh, `data` still holds the last good value and `error` is set alongside it.
 * That is deliberate: blanking a populated view over one dropped request is worse
 * than showing a stale value with a notice.
 *
 * Which gives callers their rendering rule:
 *
 *   data === null && error  ->  the error screen, with retry. Nothing to show.
 *   data !== null && error  ->  the data, plus an error notice. Never blank it.
 *   data === null && !error ->  loading.
